            <p>The secret to our food? It is pretty simple. Source fresh, quality ingredients. Prepare dishes with 
                care and passion. Serve them with a warm smile. In other words, we take pride in what we make and 
                how we share it. Even though we have grown a lot over the years, our mission is still the same:  
                Always the best food, made especially for you. </p>

                    <p class="center">The Margherita is Pomodoro or San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella di Buffala, 
                    extra virgin olive oil, and fresh basil, ingredients that don’t compete with each other. 
                    Simple ingredients in an amazing combo.</p>

                    <h2 class="h-sec center">Neapolitan Pizza</h2>
                    <p class="center">Napoli is where it all started. Neapolitan pizza is the one original. 
                    It was created in the 18th century in Naples, Italy and it all because of poverty. The 
                    poor inhabitants of Naples came up with something filling and delicious, but, most of all, 
                    affordable. So pizza came to life, and thank God for that!</p>

                    <h2 class="h-sec center"> The Sicilian Pizza</h2>
                    <p class="center">This pizza is topped with a lot of tomato sauce and cheese is usually added 
                    (if it’s added) between the dough and the sauce, stopping the crust getting soggy. Another 
                    interesting piece of info about this pizza: It is square. For toppings, it usually has tomatoes, 
                    onions, anchovies, and herbs.</p>
